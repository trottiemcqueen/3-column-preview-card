## Overview
- Put together a basic 3 column preview card using HTML/CSS. 

## My process
- Glanced over the design folder and style-guide
- Started mapping out my design in html
- Then mapped out plan in css

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What I took away from this build, was how I had to be careful and take my time
to plan what I am doing. To elaborate more. While observing the design layout, think about each task when plugging in each code (Will you need to contain more than 1 class?).

### Continued development

Where I feel I am going to keep focusing/working on would be changing the font color, columns, and adding buttons.

What I learned the most from this build, was working with 'grid' and moving around text.

### Useful resources
