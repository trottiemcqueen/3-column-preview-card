# TensorFlow Developer Course, I'm learning each of the breakdown analysis ###
### I have a new domain, Blog and new site coming up soon to help others #

*** Note *** If you're having trouble starting off where you left off in JNotebook, check illustration:
  <ul>
    <li>Hit the `Connect` button</li>
    <li>`Run` the last code/operation before disconnected</li>
    <li>`import tensorflow as tf` and `import numpy as np` input your imports what ever they may be</li>
    <li>Then your good to go! Start back coding</li>
  </ul>

    Just something I wanted to share, in case you were wondering why you kept getting error messages after
    reconnecting.![Screen Shot 2024-05-27 at 3 25 29 PM](https://github.com/trottiemcqueen/tensorflow-fundamentals/assets/123763473/306c2cd2-4918-46b9-85b4-c024099bea80)
